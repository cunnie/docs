Notes for key hijacking:

^Space is invisibly hijacked by “Input Sources”/Select the previous input source” when there’s only one input source (“invisibly” means that “Input Sources” does not show up in the left-hand list when you navigate to System Preferences→Keyboard→Shortcuts.

To verify that the key is being hijacked, navigate to System Preferences→Keyboard→Shortcuts→App Shortcuts and click “+”

Applications: All Applications
Menu Title: Ctrl-space doesn’t work
Keyboard Shortcut: ctrl-space

Try ^space.

Expected behavior: 

System Preferences→Keyboard→Input Sources→+ add an input source. System Preferences→Keyboard→Shortcuts: uncheck "Select the previous input source" (mapped to ^Space) Thanks
