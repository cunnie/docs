### Terraform

From the [terraform
tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/aws-build)

Create a `.tf` file:

```zsh
terraform init # downloads providers but not much else
terraform fmt # like go fmt
terraform validate # syntax check
terraform apply # the REAL WORK
terraform show # shows what you've created
terraform destroy # blows it all away
```
